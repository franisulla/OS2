Program1 has printed "Hello" 2 times because stdout is line buffered when connected to terminal, which was the case when I executed programs. So the child process got identical buffer with word "Hello" and both buffers just waited for "\n". In Program2 first the word displayed in terminal (because "\n" was there initially) and after that fork() occured and both buffers were empty. Then simply 2 newlines appeared.
